# whatsapp-bulk-message-sender

This is a full stack app, where frontend is in React, and backend on Nodejs.

## FrontEnd 
For the frontend you simply have to run the react app using npm start after installing node module. First you need to upload excel sheet then type message and after sending it will send messages to all the listed user.



## Backend

I am using twilio, express, node for the backend. You need an account on twilio for the bulk message sending. Replace twilio sid, authkey,and number before starting the server.
To start the server you need to type the command npm run start.
